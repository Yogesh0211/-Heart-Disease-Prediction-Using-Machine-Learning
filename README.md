# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a robust machine-learning model to predict the occurrence of heart disease based on patient data. 
The project is divided into the following key tasks:

1) Data Analysis: Analyzing the heart1.csv dataset, conducting statistical studies on variables, identifying correlations, and creating a cross-covariance matrix to determine the most predictive features for heart disease.

2) Model Training and Testing: Implementing multiple machine learning algorithms, including Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Learning, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to predict heart disease. Each algorithm is tuned for optimal performance.

3) Evaluation and Reporting: Comparing the performance of different algorithms using various metrics, selecting the best-performing model, and documenting observations in a detailed report.

4) Use Case: The developed model supports doctors by providing predictions and confidence levels for heart disease diagnoses, enhancing decision-making in clinical settings.

The project highlights data-driven approaches in healthcare, focusing on predictive accuracy and feature relevance while adhering to the principles of data governance and privacy. It also includes a professional PDF report summarizing insights, methodologies, and results.
